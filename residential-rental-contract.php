                            repairs to a smoke or carbon monoxide alarm. The Landlord shall replace or repair the smoke or carbon monoxide alarm within 15
                            days of receipt of notification if the Landlord is notified of needed replacement or repairs in writing by the Tenant. The Landlord shall
                            ensure that a smoke or carbon monoxide alarm is operable and in good repair at the beginning of the Initial Term of the Tenancy. The Landlord shall place new batteries in any battery-operated smoke or carbon monoxide alarms at the beginning of the Initial Term of the tenancy <b>and the Tenant shall replace the batteries as needed during the tenancy</b>, except where the smoke alarm is a tamper-
                            resistant, 10-year lithium battery smoke alarm.</span>
